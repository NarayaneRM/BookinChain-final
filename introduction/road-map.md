# Road Map

**Good to know:** We focus on being a user-friendly platform. We started by integrating WalletConnect, which allows the connection of several wallets, leaving it free for the user. As a subscription option, we use Chainlink's Dynamic NFTs (dNFTs), that, for us, is one of the easiest ways to make recurring On Chain charges to users. For the storage of NFTs, we use IPFS. On the network, we chose to use Polygon, since we are looking for usability and performance. For some contracts, we chose the OpenZeppelin library, as it made our development process much more dynamic and assertive. Since our project was born with the mission to impact the Latam community in the reading challenge, we see that the Ethereum Foundation is completely aligned with our purpose.
